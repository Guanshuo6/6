Hello Paul, You can see the game's logical rule code and link code in logic.ipynb and other parts of the code also have complete remarks, 
my design is that first the player has to enter the name, and then the system randomly assigns a word with a number of letters greater than
 eight according to wordhuge, the player randomly arranges and combines words according to the letters of the word, players can write up to five,
 the time is within 30 seconds, the system will judge whether the player enters the word letter is more than 6, greater than 6 will get 10 points, 
less than 6 can get 5 points, if player want to end ,type exit in advance, and finally the system will provide leaderboard aggregation information
And then out of addition to the rule code, I also put the complete code that can be interacted with in jupyternote, 
Paul can experience it, thank you for reading!
